This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate the use of generalised profiling as a method of inference for systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Two ODE models are examined: a harmonic oscillator and the Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey dynamics. These codes were written by Alexander Johnston.

All codes are written in Julia and were used to generate the figures and results in the paper "Efficient inference for differential equation models without numerical solvers" available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10494.
